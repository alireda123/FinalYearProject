// THE CODE BELOW IS FOR THE WHO WE ARE PAGE
export const whoWeAre = ` IllumiFact is an organisation created in order to highlight, correct and 
hold to account those who propagate misinformation. Having had much experience 
on different social media platforms like reddit or X, the founder of this organisation realised the grave extent 
to which false beliefs were spread on such platforms. We are merely a cog in the machine comprised
of people who recognise incorrect statements and beliefs and attempt to correct them. People already exist
who fact-check on social media, however their fact-checking is informal and not based on a robust methodology. We are 
a formal and authoritative alternative to informal fact-checking on social media and formal fact-checking by mainstream media
companies that often falls short of what British society requires. 
This platform is necessary due to the ever increasing amount of misinformation that exists which
affects the worldviews of the British population; the type of worldview that the British population
holds is the difference between a prosperous society governed by fruitful domestic policies and a failing
and dying society governed by barren domestic policies. Furthermore, the lack of information or abundance 
of misinformation can lead to complacenly with regards to crimes or injustices committed by one's own government on 
countries abroad.`
export const ourMission = `   Our mission is to correct misinformation and explain its impact and to encourage 
critical thinking and media literacy. The most important objective is to encourage critical 
thinking. Critical thinking not only allows one to identify misinformation, but allows one to 
evaluate information comprehensively and form informed opinions. Critical thinkers are not dogmatic, 
nor are they tribalistic in terms of their identification with their beliefs. A society of critical thinkers
is a prosperous society. We assume you already have seen the tribalistic and dogmatic nature of discussions 
on social media on platforms such as X or Reddit. Discussions are shallow and full of insults and accusations, rather than 
having depth and a mutual respect for each other's beliefs. Our mission is also to encourage media literacy, since a media 
literate populace will be able to recognise biases in different media outlets, combat misinformation, rely on reliable sources
and make informed decisions.   `
export const definingUnbiased = ` Our take on what is classified as 'unbiased' or 'being neutral' is different to what mainstream media companies or fact-checking organisations may espouse.
We shall exemplify this through the following example. Two parties are in a conflict. One party has objectively been shown to produce misinformation repeatedly,
to the extent that if that party were a person they would be considered a chronic liar, whilst the other party has had its evidence corroborated by many sources 
such as UN and humans rights organisations. The idea of neutrality espoused by mainstream media companies results in them attaching  equal significance to both parties,
and even providing many oppurtunities for the party that espouses misinformation to provide misinformation through interviews. In our view, this is pseudo-neutrality, which on the surface
appears to give the illusion of fairness and honesty, whereas it is actually grounded on either naivety or conformation to a worldview or agenda the mainstream media organisation possesses.<br/><br/>
This pseudo-neutrality is what, in our view, perpetuates conflicts around the world, since conflicts are perpetuated through the decisions of politicians; the decisions of politicians are based on information and 
based on the outlook of their society. If that society is fed misinformation through the guise of neutrality(or even bias), and that society lacks the ability to critically think, many members of that society will end up
supporting conflicts or domestic policies that do not have their best interests at heart.`
